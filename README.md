Basic Finance Application 

Finance Application to let users keep track of transactions and make goals. 

Models create a framework for transactions and goals, json maps for local storage. 

Providers provide methods to be used in screens and manage the theme changes.

Screens provide UI for users to interact with and call methods from providers based on user input. 

Services folder contains database_helper.dart to keep local storage for a device. 

Widgets folder contains transaction.tile.dart that provides basic UI when a user wants to add a transaction, not a screen since it is more similar to a popup prompt.
